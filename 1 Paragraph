The hypothetical object I chose to talk about would be for The Escape The Bank idea. The item would be the money that would be used by the players during their game
time. The money used can be made of green printing paper since their is a NO Budget restrant issued onto our project.
The money/ currency will look like an actual U.S. dollar bill or something close enough to it.
The currency will be given to the players while they play the game. Whenever the players answer any puzzles or riddles that are given to them
they are awarded with this currency that will be tallied up in the end to see hwo much a group made as a whole. This mechanic can be used to amke the game more competitive
between the groups to see what groups make the most by the end of everyone's sessions. The currency can be used by players if they need to try and stall out the police from entering the
room and capturing them but they will lose their earnings little by little if they continue to bribe them which will cause them to
earn less by the time they actually escape the room itself.
